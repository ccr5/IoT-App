# Introduction
It's a project to help students to learning about IoT. This repository is a amount of documents to create a IoT project when you have the code of Arduino, ESP8266 and Python App to control all. 

# Object
It's a open project that everybody can use to create a IoT environment.

# What can I do with this?
You will need to: 
1. 2 un - Arduino Uno R3
2. 2 un - ESP8266 NodeMCU CP2101
3. 1 un - Display LCD
4. 1 un - Biometric Sensor
5. 1 un - Lock
6. 1 un - Relay
7. 1 un - Lamp

Charge each ArduinoWifiScript in an Arduino and WifiScript in an ESP8266 NodeMCU and use jumpers to connect every pin in its respective component. Done! You just need power in each system. Until run the app, change the IP and WiFi network in WifiScript and citig.kv to works.

# Next steps
Share with your friends and have a fun!
