# Introduction
It's a project to help students to learning about Internet of Things. 
There is many documents to help to create a IoT project as Arduino and ESP8266 NodeMCU scripts and a Python App to control all.
it's part of a scientific research that we want to help everybody to control and protect your home and you can read about in my LinkedIn:

# Object
A open project that everybody can use to create a IoT environment.

# What can I do with this?
You will need to: 
1. 2 un - Arduino Uno R3
2. 2 un - ESP8266 NodeMCU CP2101
3. 1 un - Display LCD 16x2
4. 1 un - Biometric Sensor
5. 1 un - Lock
6. 1 un - Relay
7. 1 un - Lamp

You must to charge each ArduinoWifiScript in an Arduino and WifiScript in an ESP8266 NodeMCU. 
Using jumpers to connect every pin in its respective component. Done! You just need power in each system. 
Until run the app, change the IP and WiFi network in WifiScript.ino and citig.kv to works.

# Next steps
Share with your friends and have a fun!
